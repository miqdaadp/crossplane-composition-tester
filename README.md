# Crossplane Composition Tester
Test Crossplane compositions implemented with composition functions using BDD (Behavior Driven Development). 
If you're not familiar with BDD, check out [this](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/). 

[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/) is a popular BDD framework for testing. It follows the 
[Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) syntax for writing tests (Given, When, Then).
To run the tests, we use [behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which 
is a python implementation of Cucumber. We also use Python to implement the steps of the tests.


## Installation
You need to have the [**Crossplane CLI**](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/cli/) and [**behave**](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed. You will also need to install
the other dependencies in `requirements.txt` for the python steps implementation of the features.
```bash
# Install the python dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the latest version of crossplane cli
curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossplane/crossplane/master/install.sh" | sh
```

You also need to have **Docker running** since the tests are run inside a docker container.


## Quick start 
In order to get started, we set up an [example composition for a service account](test/pkg/service-account-with-functions/composition.yaml) inside the `test` folder.

The composition will create the following resources:
- a `Role`
- a default `Policy`
- a list of policies ARNs provided in the claim
- a `RolePolicyAttachment` for each policy **once the role and the policies are ready** 
- a `ServiceAccount` object **once the role is ready**

Now you can explore the [feature file](test/composition-tests/service-account-with-functions/service-account.feature) we've written to get an idea
of how to write features and test different use cases.

You can run the tests with the following command:
```bash
behave test
```

You can check out what options are available for the `behave` command by running
```bash
behave --help
```
Some useful options include `--tags` or `-t` to run only scenarios with a certain tag. Some tags related to the severity 
of the scenario or the feature (like "minor" or "critical") are specific to test reporting tools like [allure](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-python/blob/master/allure-behave/examples/severity.rst).

**Note**: IDEs like Pycharm have a built-in support for behave and other BDD frameworks will allow you to run the tests directly from the IDE.

You can also use our custom `tests_runner.sh` script, that runs the tests against a target folder with feature files and generates cucumber and allure reports that you can view in your CI tool.
```bash
./tests_runner.sh test/composition-tests
```
Here is an example output with the Jenkins allure plugin

## Motivation
Crossplane compositions files can become complex and in turn very error-prone.
So far, there hasn't been a clear or easy way to test your crossplane compositions in a quick and reproducible way
other than to test them live in a cluster. This is not ideal for a few reasons:
- It can be a very slow process depending on the composition
- It's not easy to debug
- It does not allow you to test with different combination of inputs (i.e. different configurations).

This tool aims to solve this problem by allowing you to test your compositions locally and quickly, as well as define tests
in a way that is easy to read and reason about. This tool relies on two main components:
- [behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - A python implementation of Cucumber, that allows you to define your tests in plain english
in a BDD (Given, When, Then) format. 
- Crossplane CLI with the [*render* functionality](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/cli/command-reference/#beta-render).

The Crossplane v1.14 release introduced a new major feature, [composition functions](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/composition-functions/).
Composition functions allow you to define your composition programmatically using a language of your choice (python, go, etc). 
It came accompanied by the very convenient [render command in the crossplane CLI](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/composition-functions/#test-a-composition-that-uses-functions).
Given a composition that uses composition functions, this command allows you to render it locally without having to spin up a kubernetes cluster and
see the output that will be passed to the providers if you were to run it inside a cluster.

Combining both the power of the crossplane `render` command and the BDD approach, we now have a very powerful and expressive way
to test our compositions. In the end, whether you write your compositions in yaml or as code with the new composition functions feature,
this tool can become very valuable in validating your compositions with different use cases.

## Features
Check [the features README in the docs](docs/features.md) to get an overview of how to write features and the rationale behind them in the context of testing Crossplane compositions.

## How it works
Check [how this tool works](docs/how_it_works.md).

## CI/CD Integration
`Behave` has very good integration with test-reporting tools like [Allure](https://allurereport.org/). 

For example in Jenkins, you can install the [Allure plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/allure-jenkins-plugin/), and
then run the `tests_runner.sh` script which will run the tests with `behave` and generate allure-reports that can 
then be viewed in Jenkins as seen in the [Quickstart](##quick-start).

## Steps Reference

This is an overview of all the step types that are currently supported. They reflect the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern to structure tests.

### When (Act)

Currently, the only supported action is `crossplane renders the composition` which will run the crossplane `render` command with the given inputs from your feature file.
